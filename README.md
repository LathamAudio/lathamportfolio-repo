In 2020 I joined Hi-Rez studios as a Senior Technical Sound Designer on Rogue Company to work on audio implementation and mix, including HRTF and environmental reverb.

I spoke at GameSoundCon '21 as part of a deep dive into the Hi-Rez Audio team on the benefits of setting aside specific time for audio R&D

In 2021 I started worked with Red Beard Games as the Audio Lead on Divine Knockout where I managed teams creating sound design, music and VO for the game

In 2022 I joined Firewalk Studios as a Senior Technical Audio Designer on Concord. I worked with teams of amazing sound designers, musicians, and VO artists to implement and build dynamic audio systems.
