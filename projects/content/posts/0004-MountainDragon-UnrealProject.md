summary: "An Unreal Project to implement audio for the Mountain Dragon creature"
---
Have you watched & listened to 'How To Train Your Dragon' or 'Game of Thrones' and thought "I could do that!" Have you ever wanted to work on improving your creature design chops? Have you wanted to work on implementing your audio in the Unreal Engine with both Metasounds and Wwise to compare them? Are you me, because that is a very specific set of goals? Anyways, here is your chance!

This is the Mountain Dragon from the Quadraped Fantasy Creatures for the Unreal Engine found on Fab.com. It comes as a set of creatures that have all the textures, animations, and skeletal mesh needed to get started but no audio! That's where we come in. I have set up the Mountain Dragon with basic movement, flying, and attack controls and setup the audio hooks to implement your own sound design. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Metasounds or Wwise - Which do I choose?
At this point it is time to download the audio setup for the Mountain Dragon and you have a choice of two implementations, Metasounds or Wwise.

**Metasounds** - If you want the most direct path for getting started on your sound design for the dragon then choose the Metasounds option. Metasounds are part of the native Unreal Engine audio system and does not require running any external authoring tools to implement your audio. Go to the [Download Metasounds Audio Setup](#download-metasounds-audio-setup) section below for the next steps in the setup process.

**Wwise** - If you are interested in learning more about the using Wwise audio system with the Unreal Engine then choose this option. As an added bonus this version still has all the same audio setup in Metasounds so this is a great opportunity to compare the two systems and see if one works better for you or just to improve your chops on both systems. Go to the [Download Wwise Audio Setup](#download-wwise-audio-setup) section below for the next steps in the setup process.

## Adding the Mountain Dragon to other maps
Now that we have a dragon that can walk, fly, attack, breathe fire, launch fireballs we don't just want to use the test environment. The "Stylized Fantasy Provencal" environment is an appropriate setting for testing out your dragon sound design.
1. From Fab.com download "**Stylized Fantasy Provencal**", and add it to your project
	- https://www.fab.com/listings/ced19ea1-31ed-437f-ae64-2b6b1561fede
2. Open the "Main" level located in "StylizedProvencal/Maps"
3. With the Default Pawn set in the Game Mode set you should be able to download envoronments from Fab.com and use the Mountain Dragon in all of them!
